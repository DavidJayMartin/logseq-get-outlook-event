# Outlook Events Logseq Plugin

A Logseq plugin that fetches events from your local Outlook calendar and inserts them into your journal pages. This plugin consists of two components: a Logseq plugin (JavaScript) and a local API service (Python) that reads from your Outlook OST file.

## Features

- üìÖ Fetches events from your local Outlook calendar
- üìù Inserts events directly into Logseq journal pages
- ‚è∞ Displays events in chronological order (earliest to latest)
- üë• Shows attendees for each event (with configurable exclusions)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Calculates and displays event duration
- üè∑Ô∏è Uses Logseq properties for structured data
- üîÉ Shows recurring event indicator
- üîó Automatically detects and creates meeting links
- ‚öôÔ∏è Fully configurable through Logseq plugin settings
- üìã Customizable output format templates

## Components

### 1. Logseq Plugin (`main.js`)
The main plugin that runs within Logseq and provides the `/Get Events` slash command.

### 2. API Service (`outlook_events_api.py`)
A local Flask API service that connects to your Outlook installation and retrieves calendar events.

### 3. Service Management Scripts
- `start_api_service.bat` - Starts the API service in background
- `launch_api.vbs` - VBScript for silent startup (used with Task Scheduler)

## Prerequisites

- **Logseq** installed and running
- **Microsoft Outlook** installed on Windows with access to your calendar
- **Python 3.x** installed
- Required Python packages: `flask`, `pywin32`

## Installation

### Step 1: Set up Project Files

1. **Create the plugin directory:**
   - Open your Logseq graph/workspace folder (where your pages and journals are stored)
   - Create a new folder named `logseq-get-outlook-events` in the root of your Logseq directory
   - This keeps all plugin files organized together in your workspace

2. **Copy all project files to the plugin directory:**
   - `main.js` (Logseq plugin)
   - `outlook_events_api.py` (API service)
   - `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies)
   - `start_api_service.bat` (Service management script)
   - Any other related files

   Your folder structure should look like:
   ```
   YourLogseqWorkspace/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ journals/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outlook-events-plugin/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outlook_events_api.py
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start_api_service.bat
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (other plugin files)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (other Logseq files)
   ```

### Step 2: Set up the Python API Service

1. **Open the Command Prompt and navigate to the plugin directory:**
   ```bash
   cd YourLogseqWorkspace\logseq-get-outlook-events
   ```

2. **(Optional but Recommended) Create a virtual environment:**
   
   A virtual environment isolates this project's Python dependencies from your system-wide Python installation. This prevents version conflicts with other Python projects and keeps your system clean.
   
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment in the plugin directory
   python -m venv .venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   ```
   
   When the virtual environment is active, you'll see `(.venv)` in your command prompt.

3. **Install required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Test the API service:**
   ```bash
   python outlook_events_api.py
   ```
   
   The service will start on `http://localhost:5000`. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it for now.

**Note:** If you created a virtual environment, the `start_api_service.bat` script will automatically use it. For manual starts, remember to activate it (`.venv\Scripts\activate`) each time.

### Step 3: Install the Logseq Plugin

1. **Enable the plugin in Logseq:**
   - Open Logseq
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Plugins
   - Click "Load unpacked plugin"
   - Navigate to and select your `logseq-get-outlook-events` folder
   - The plugin should now appear in your plugins list

### Step 4: (Optional) Set up Automatic API Service Startup

For convenience, you can configure the API service to start automatically when you log into Windows using Task Scheduler.

#### Configure Task Scheduler

1. **Open Task Scheduler:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, and press Enter
   - Or search for "Task Scheduler" in the Start menu

2. **Create a new task:**
   - In the right panel, click "Create Task..." (not "Create Basic Task")

3. **General Tab:**
   - Name: `Outlook Events API Service`
   - Description: `Automatically starts the Outlook Events API service for Logseq plugin`
   - Check "Run only when user is logged on"
   - Check "Run with highest privileges" (recommended for COM access)

4. **Triggers Tab:**
   - Click "New..."
   - Begin the task: "At log on"
   - Settings: "Specific user" (should show your username)
   - Check "Delay task for: 30 seconds" (gives system time to fully load)
   - Click "OK"

5. **Actions Tab:**
   - Click "New..."
   - Action: "Start a program"
   - Program/script: `cmd.exe`
   - Add arguments: `/c "C:\path\to\your\logseq\workspace\logseq-get-outlook-events\launch_api.vbs"` (replace with actual path)
   - Click "OK"

6. **Conditions Tab:**
   - Uncheck all boxes

7. **Settings Tab:**
   - Check "Allow task to be run on demand"
   - Check "If the task fails, restart every" and select 1 minute and 3 attempts in the dropdowns 
   - Check "If the running task does not end when requested, force it to stop"
   - Set "If task is already running, then the following rule applies" to "Do not start a new instance"
   - Click "OK"

8. **Save the Task**
   - Click "OK"

8. **Test the scheduled task:**
   - Right-click on your new task in the Task Scheduler Library
   - Select "Run" to test it
   - Check if the API service starts by visiting [`http://localhost:5000/health`](http://localhost:5000/health) in your browser.  You should get the following response:
   ```json
   { 
   "outlook_status": "running",
   "service": "Outlook Events API",
   "status": "healthy" 
   }
   ```
   - You can then check that the service is also returning events from your calendar by visiting [`http://localhost:5000/events/{date}`](http://localhost:5000/events/{date}), but replace "{date}" with a day you know you have an event on your calendar. The response should look something like this:
   ```json
   {
   "date": "2025-08-21",
   "events": [
      {
         "attendees": [
         "Name, Your",
         "Simpson, Homer"
         ],
         "description": "Agenda: \n\r Review current safety procedures for plant shutdown.",
         "end": "2025-08-21 15:30:00+00:00",
         "isRecurring": true,
         "location": "Microsoft Teams Meeting",
         "meetingLinks": [],
         "start": "2025-08-21 15:00:00+00:00",
         "subject": "Homer Touchbase"
      }
   ],
   "success": true
   }
   ```

#### Verify Automatic Startup

After setting up the scheduled task:

1. **Restart your computer** to test automatic startup
2. **Wait about 1-2 minutes** after logging in (allow time for the delayed start)
3. **Test the service** by opening a web browser and going to [`http://localhost:5000/health`](http://localhost:5000/health)
4. You should see:
```json
   { 
   "outlook_status": "running",
   "service": "Outlook Events API",
   "status": "healthy" 
   }
   ```

#### Managing the Automatic Service

- **To disable automatic startup:** Open Task Scheduler, find your task, right-click and select "Disable"
- **To modify the startup delay:** Edit the task, go to Triggers tab, and change the delay time
- **To stop the service manually:** Use the provided `stop_api_service.bat` file

## Usage

### Starting the Services

**If you set up automatic startup:** The API service should start automatically when you log in. Just open Logseq and start using the plugin.

**If you prefer manual startup:**

1. **Start the Python API service first:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Direct command
   python outlook_events_api.py
   
   # Option 2: Using the batch file (runs in background)
   start_api_service.bat
   ```
   Keep this running while using the plugin.

2. **Open Logseq** and navigate to a journal page (daily note)

3. **Use the slash command:**
   - Type `/Get Events` in any block
   - The plugin will fetch events for that journal date
   - Events will be inserted as blocks below your cursor

### Event Format

Each event is inserted as a block with the following default format:

```
Event Title üîÉ [Join Meeting](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/...)
event-time:: 9:00 AM
event-duration:: 01:00:00
attendees:: [Homer Simpson], [Diana Prince]
```

Where:
- üîÉ indicates a recurring event
- Meeting links are automatically detected and added as clickable links
- All fields are customizable through plugin settings

## Configuration

The plugin is fully configurable through Logseq's plugin settings. Access settings via:
**Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Get Outlook Events**

### Meeting Links Feature

The plugin automatically scans event descriptions for meeting links and adds clickable "Join Meeting" links to event titles. 

**How it works:**
1. Configure the meeting base URLs in settings (e.g., `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join`)
2. The plugin searches event descriptions for URLs starting with these base URLs
3. Found links are added as `[Join Meeting](URL)` next to the event title
4. Multiple links are numbered: `[Join Meeting 1](URL1) [Join Meeting 2](URL2)`

### API Endpoints

The Python service provides several endpoints:

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /events/YYYY-MM-DD` - Get events for specific date
- `GET /events/today` - Get today's events
- `GET /events?date=YYYY-MM-DD&meeting_urls=url1,url2` - Get events with meeting URL detection

Examples:
```
http://localhost:5000/events/2025-08-19
http://localhost:5000/events/today
http://localhost:5000/events/2025-08-19?meeting_urls=https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join
```

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Output Templates

You can create complex event layouts using the output format template. Here are some examples:

#### Minimal Format
```
{subject}
{time}
```

#### Detailed Format with Child Blocks
```
{subject}
event-time:: {time}
event-duration:: {duration}
---CHILD---
location:: {location}
---CHILD---
description:: {description}
---CHILD---
attendees:: {attendees}
```

#### Meeting-Focused Format
```
## {subject}
‚è∞ {time} | ‚è±Ô∏è {duration}
üìç {location}
üë• {attendees}
```

### Recurring Events

Recurring events are automatically identified and marked with a üîÉ emoji. You can configure bracket settings to automatically create page links for recurring events only.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No events found" message:**
   - Ensure the Python API service is running
   - Check that you're on a journal page (daily note)
   - Verify events exist in Outlook for that date
   - Occasionaly the API service disconnects from the Outlook COM.  Stopping and restarting the service should correct the issue

2. **API connection errors:**
   - Confirm the Python service is running on localhost:5000
   - Check the API URL setting in plugin configuration
   - Ensure Windows Firewall isn't blocking the connection

3. **Meeting links not appearing:**
   - Verify meeting base URLs are configured correctly
   - Check that meeting links in Outlook match the configured base URLs
   - Ensure the Python service is receiving the meeting URLs parameter

4. **Plugin not loading:**
   - Verify the plugin folder structure
   - Check Logseq's plugin settings
   - Review browser console for JavaScript errors

5. **Formatting issues:**
   - Check the output format template for syntax errors
   - Ensure `\n` is used for line breaks, not actual newlines
   - Verify template variable names are spelled correctly

6. **Automatic startup not working:**
   - Check Task Scheduler to ensure the task is enabled and configured correctly
   - Verify the path to `launch_api.vbs` is correct in the scheduled task
   - Try running the scheduled task manually to test it
   - Check Windows Event Viewer for any error messages related to the task

### Debug Information

The plugin logs detailed information to Logseq's console. Open Developer Tools (CTRL + Shift + i) to view debug output.

## Technical Details

### Time Handling

- Events are fetched in Outlook's local timezone
- Times are displayed in either 12-hour format (9:00 AM) or 24-hour format (09:00) based on plugin settings
- Duration is always calculated and displayed as HH:MM:SS format

### Data Flow

1. User triggers `/Get Events` command on a journal page
2. Plugin extracts the journal date and configuration settings
3. API request sent to Python service with meeting URL parameters
4. Python service queries Outlook COM interface and extracts meeting links
5. Events returned as JSON with meeting links included
6. Plugin formats events using configured templates and inserts as Logseq blocks

### Meeting Link Detection

The Python service uses regular expressions to find URLs in event descriptions that start with the configured base URLs. It handles:
- Multiple meeting links per event
- Various URL formats and parameters
- Cleaning up URLs (removing trailing punctuation)

### Service Management

The background service management system includes:
- **Process detection and PID tracking** for reliable service control
- **Automatic cleanup** of stale process files
- **Log rotation** to prevent log files from growing too large
- **Silent background operation** using VBScript for Task Scheduler integration

## Security Notes

- The API service only runs locally (localhost)
- No external network connections required
- Calendar data never leaves your local machine
- Uses Windows COM interface for secure Outlook access
- Meeting links are passed as URL parameters but only between local services
